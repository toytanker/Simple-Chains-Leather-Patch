Owlchemist did an incredible job on the main mod and addressed all the leather found in the base game, plus many other mods.

Where they left off, others will continue to hold the torch and expand its reach into additional mods have unique animals, hides and leathers ready for the tanning vat!

Check out rebelscum's patch for Dinosauria https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1900608998

and use this one here for:

1. Alpha Animals [there was one leather type that's not in Owlchemist main mod: NightLeather]
2. Dragon Mod
3. Magical Menagerie
4. Vanilla Animals Expanded — Arid Shrubland
5. Vanilla Animals Expanded — Ice Sheet

Let me know if there's additional leather types out there we need to bring out of the fold ^.^

Happy Hiding out there!
